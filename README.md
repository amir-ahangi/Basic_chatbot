The attached Flask application is a lightweight search application based on keywords that responds to user queries through an HTTP API. The application uses a simple dictionary as a data source, with keywords such as 'aspirin' and 'ibuprofen' relating to information about their usage and influence. When a query from the user arrives via the /query POST endpoint, it is parsed; keywords are extracted and then searched for in the predefined dictionary. If the keyword matches, the relevant information is retrieved and returned as a response. The time for the query processing for each query execution is measured and logged, which would give an idea of how efficient or not the system operation is. Useful for performance monitoring and possible enhancements.
